## Back to the Checkout
Back to the supermarket. This week, we’ll implement the code for a checkout system that handles pricing schemes such as “apples cost 50 cents, three apples cost $1.30.”

Way back in KataOne we thought about how to model the various options for supermarket pricing. We looked at things such as “three for a dollar,” “$1.99 per pound,” and “buy two, get one free.”

This week, let’s implement the code for a supermarket checkout that calculates the total price of a number of items. In a normal supermarket, things are identified using Stock Keeping Units, or SKUs. In our store, we’ll use individual letters of the alphabet (A, B, C, and so on). Our goods are priced individually. In addition, some items are multipriced: buy n of them, and they’ll cost you y cents. For example, item ‘A’ might cost 50 cents individually, but this week we have a special offer: buy three ‘A’s and they’ll cost you $1.30. In fact this week’s prices are:

  
    Item  Unit     Special
          Price    Price
    --------------------------
    A     50       3 for 130
    B     30       2 for 45
    C     20
    D     15
Our checkout accepts items in any order, so that if we scan a B, an A, and another B, we’ll recognize the two B’s and price them at 45 (for a total price so far of 95). Because the pricing changes frequently, we need to be able to pass in a set of pricing rules each time we start handling a checkout transaction.

The interface to the checkout should look like:

```JS
co = CheckOut.new(pricing_rules)
co.scan(item)
co.scan(item)
    :    :
price = co.total
```
Here’s a set of unit tests for a Ruby implementation. The helper method price lets you specify a sequence of items using a string, calling the checkout’s scan method on each item in turn before finally returning the total price.

```Ruby
class TestPrice < Test::Unit::TestCase

  def price(goods)
    co = CheckOut.new(RULES)
    goods.split(//).each { |item| co.scan(item) }
    co.total
  end

  def test_totals
    assert_equal(  0, price(""))
    assert_equal( 50, price("A"))
    assert_equal( 80, price("AB"))
    assert_equal(115, price("CDBA"))

    assert_equal(100, price("AA"))
    assert_equal(130, price("AAA"))
    assert_equal(180, price("AAAA"))
    assert_equal(230, price("AAAAA"))
    assert_equal(260, price("AAAAAA"))

    assert_equal(160, price("AAAB"))
    assert_equal(175, price("AAABB"))
    assert_equal(190, price("AAABBD"))
    assert_equal(190, price("DABABA"))
  end

  def test_incremental
    co = CheckOut.new(RULES)
    assert_equal(  0, co.total)
    co.scan("A");  assert_equal( 50, co.total)
    co.scan("B");  assert_equal( 80, co.total)
    co.scan("A");  assert_equal(130, co.total)
    co.scan("A");  assert_equal(160, co.total)
    co.scan("B");  assert_equal(175, co.total)
  end
end
```
There are lots of ways of implementing this kind of algorithm; if you have time, experiment with several.

### Objectives of the Kata
To some extent, this is just a fun little problem. But underneath the covers, it’s a stealth exercise in decoupling. The challenge description doesn’t mention the format of the pricing rules. How can these be specified in such a way that the checkout doesn’t know about particular items and their pricing strategies? How can we make the design flexible enough so that we can add new styles of pricing rule in the future?

## Output

🎉 To extend the requirements, I also added UI and routes by react, not only solving the problem and adding some tests, but also:
- Visible UI to show all existing special price rules
- Available to add new rules
- Add product to UI by clicking product quick keys
- Implement `total` calculation while adding product to cart (list)
- Available to clear the carts

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
